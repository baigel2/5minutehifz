<h1 id="five-minute-hifz">Five Minute Hifz:</h1>
<p>Welcome to my experiment in Quran memorisation.</p>
<p>You can read about the inspiration behind the method on my blog <a
href="peopleofthebook.co.uk/posts/hifz1">People Of The Book</a></p>
<p>The method and steps are layed out below.</p>
<p>Files:</p>
<p>I have a Journal folder where I will keep track of my progress, what
Surahs/Verses I’m trying to learn and how it’s going.</p>
<p>The naming convention will be date_surah_verses_brief.md for example
21.5.25_103_2-3_done.md means that on 21.5.25 I completed the first
memorisation of surah 103 (Al-Asr) verses 2-3.</p>
<p>Obviously the file itself will contain the full journal entry.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-five-minute-hifz-method.">The Five Minute Hifz Method.</h1>
<p>Or just ‘Five Minute Hifz’. I think that sounds better.</p>
<p>As of 21.05.2025 I still need to make the repo and start the
experiment in a somewhat reproducable manner. However for now the basics
are as follows:</p>
<p>To make things easier, I will refer to the ‘commiting to memory’
stage as input and the ‘recalling the verses’ stage as recall. There
will also be a revision stage as you will see below.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-input.">Stage 1: Input.</h2>
<p>Around Fajr time, either before or just after you pray, spend up a
maximum of 5 mins (yes maximum) revising a verse or a number of verses
you want to learn.</p>
<p>As I’m exeptionally slow at reading Arabic I also listen to audio
(with airpods) of the verses I’m trying to learn while reading along and
following the words on the Quran app.</p>
<p>If you’re learning a short enough Surah you can listen to the whole
surah.</p>
<p>When the 5 mins are up, close your Quran or Quran app and stop any
audio recordings of the verses you were listenting to.</p>
<p>You are now no longer allowed to listen to or read that those verses
(by sight) for the rest of the day until you’re basically about to go to
bed.</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-recall.">Stage 2: Recall.</h2>
<p>Throught the day, try as much as you can to recall the verses you
read in the morning. Don’t worry if at first it seems almost impossible
or you only remember one verse.</p>
<p>Whatever you can remember is progress and the more you try (over
time) the better you will get at recalling verses.</p>
<p>If you remember several verses but you’re unsure of the order of some
of them, only recite the verses that your are sure are in the correct
order and leave the rest for the revision stage.</p>
<p>If you are able to recite at least 3 verses that you’re sure are in
the right order it’s very helpful to use them in Salah after Al-Fathiha
to strengthen your memory even more.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-revision.">Stage 3: Revision.</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, preferrably as the last thing you do before
you go to sleep, open your Quran and audio app if you need it and revise
the verses you were trying to learn.</p>
<p>You can spend as long as you need to or have time for at this stage
but take note of the verses you struggled with and repeat them several
times and then the whole segment you’re trying to learn.</p>
<p>Doing this last thing before bed will ensure it is brought to the
attention of your subconcious mind which will carry on proccessing the
verses while you sleep.</p>
<p>Often when I wake up the verses I’m trying to learn are the first
thing that come to mind.</p>
<p>Ok, so this is the basic method which I will improve and refine over
time. The goal however is to keep it as simple but effective as possible
and allow me to progress on my Hifz journey with as little time devoted
to the input stage as possible.</p>
<p>Right now I’m imagining if it might be possible to get to a stage one
day where I can commit a verse to memory after reading it only once.
We’ll see.</p>
