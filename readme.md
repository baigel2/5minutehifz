# Five Minute Hifz:

Welcome to my experiment in Quran memorisation.

You can read about the inspiration behind the method on my blog [People Of The Book](https://baigel2.github.io/people/post/hifz1/)

The method and steps are layed out below.

## Files:

I have a Journal folder where I will keep track of my progress, what Surahs/Verses I'm trying to learn and how it's going.

The naming convention will be date_surah_verses_brief.md for example 21.5.25_103_2-3_done.md means that on 21.5.25 I completed the first memorisation of surah 103 (Al-Asr) verses 2-3.

Obviously the file itself will contain the full journal entry.

# Five Minute Hifz.

To make things easier, I will refer to the 'commiting to memory' stage as input and the 'recalling the verses' stage as recall. There will also be a revision stage as you will see below.


## Stage 1: Input.

Around Fajr time, either before or just after you pray, spend up to a maximum of 5 mins (yes maximum) revising a verse or a number of verses you want to learn.

Why 5 minutes? No, not just because that’s the name of the method. Limiting your practice time in the morning as well as not looking at the verses or listening to them throught the day tricks your brain into thinking that this information is more rare and therefore more valuable.

In mnemonics (The scientific study of memory) there is a famous technique for memorising vast ammounts of information known as the memory palace. One of it’s noteworthy points is, the stranger and rarer you can make a piece of information seem, the more likeley it is to stick.

So, by creating the illusion of rarity the hope is that the brain will assign greater importance to the information than if the classical method was used (because the classical method engulfs the student in an ocean of repetition) and so is more likeley to hold onto it.

As I'm exeptionally slow at reading Arabic I also listen to audio (with airpods) of the verses I'm trying to learn while reading along and following the words on the Quran app.

If you're learning a short enough Surah you can listen to the whole surah.

When the 5 mins are up, close your Quran or Quran app and stop any audio recordings of the verses you were listenting to.

You are now no longer allowed to listen to or read those verses (by sight) for the rest of the day until you're basically about to go to bed.

## Stage 2: Recall.

Throught the day, try as much as you can to recall the verses you read in the morning. Don't worry if at first it seems almost impossible or you only remember one verse. You don’t have to constantly recall the verses either. It should be casual and throught the day in a way that isn’t stressfull or preassuring.

Whatever you can remember is progress and the more you try (over time) the better you will get at recalling verses.

If you remember several verses but you're unsure of the order of some of them, only recite the verses that your are sure are in the correct order and leave the rest for the revision stage.

If you are able to recite at least 3 verses that you're sure are in the right order it's very helpful to use them in Salah after Al-Fathiha to strengthen your memory even more.

## Stage 3: Revision.

At the end of the day, preferrably as the last thing you do before you go to sleep, open your Quran and audio app if you need it and revise the verses you were trying to learn.

You can spend as long as you need to or have time for at this stage but take note of the verses you struggled with and repeat them several times and then the whole segment you're trying to learn.

Doing this last thing before bed will ensure it is brought to the attention of your subconcious mind which will carry on proccessing the verses while you sleep.

Often when I wake up the verses I'm trying to learn are the first thing that come to mind.

Ok, so this is the basic method which I will improve and refine over time. The goal however is to keep it as simple but effective as possible and allow me to progress on my Hifz journey with as little time devoted to the input stage as possible.

Right now I'm imagining if it might be possible to get to a stage one day where I can commit a verse to memory after reading it only once. We'll see.
